        <h2>Jammula Sri Laxmi Sathwika acts in a play</h2>
        <h4>Hedda Gabler</h4>
        <h5>Author: Henrik Ibsen</h5>
        <p> SCENE: "TESMANS' evening: drawing room dark, back room aglow, glass door draped."</p>
        <h6 class="HEDDA">HEDDA</h6>
        <p class="direction">[Holds out her hand.]</p>
        <p class="speech">I have heard the news already, as you see. Tesman sent me a card.</p>
        <h6 class="MISSTESMAN">MISS TESMAN.</h6>
        <p class="direction">[In the doorway between the rooms.]</p>
        <p class="speech">Yes, he promised me he would. But nevertheless I thought that to
            Hedda--here in the house of life--I ought myself to bring the tidings of
            death.</p>
        <h6 class="HEDDA">HEDDA.</h6>
        <p class="direction">[Gently freeing herself.]</p>
        <p class="speech">That was very kind of you.</p>
        <h6 class="MISSTESMAN">MISS TESMAN</h6>
        <p class="direction">[In quiet emotion.]</p>
        <p class="speech">Ah, Rina ought not to have left us just now. This is not the time for
            Hedda's house to be a house of mourning.</p>
        <h6 class="HEDDA">HEDDA</h6>
        <p class="direction">[Crossing the room.] </p>
        <p class="speech">She died quite peacefully, did she not, Miss Tesman?</p>
        <h6 class="MISSTESMAN">MISS TESMAN</h6>
        <p class="direction">[Who has stopped and turned.]</p>
        <p class="speech">Oh, her end was so calm, so beautiful. And then she had the unspeakable
            happiness of seeing George once more--and bidding him good-bye.--Has he
            not come home yet?</p>
        <h6 class="BRACK">BRACK</h6>
        <p class="direction">[With a glance at her.]</p> 
        <p class="speech">What makes you think that, Madam? Perhaps you have already heard something--?</p>
        <h6 class="HEDDA">HEDDA</h6>
        <p class="direction">[At the glass door, impatiently.]</p>
        <p class="speech">No. He wrote that he might be detained. But won't you sit down?</p>
