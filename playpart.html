        <h2>Jammula Sri Laxmi Sathwika acts in a play</h2>
        <h4>Hedda Gabler</h4>
        <h5>Author: Henrik Ibsen</h5>
        <p> SCENE: "TESMANS' evening: drawing room dark, back room aglow, glass door draped."</p>
        <h6>HEDDA.</h6><p>[Holds out her hand.]</p><p>I have heard the news already, as you see. Tesman sent me a card.</p>
        <h6>MISS TESMAN.</h6><p>[In the doorway between the rooms.]</p><p>Yes, he promised me he would. But nevertheless I thought that to
            Hedda--here in the house of life--I ought myself to bring the tidings of
            death.</p>
        <h6>HEDDA.</h6><p>[Gently freeing herself.]</p><p>That was very kind of you.</p>
        <h6>MISS TESMAN</h6><p>[In quiet emotion.]</p><p>Ah, Rina ought not to have left us just now. This is not the time for
            Hedda's house to be a house of mourning.
            </p>
        <h6>HEDDA</h6><p>[Crossing the room.] </p><p>She died quite peacefully, did she not, Miss
            Tesman?</p>
        <h6>MISS TESMAN</h6><p>[Who has stopped and turned.]</p><p>Oh, her end was so calm, so beautiful. And then she had the unspeakable
            happiness of seeing George once more--and bidding him good-bye.--Has he
            not come home yet?</p>
        <h6>HEDDA</h6><p>[At the glass door, impatiently.]</p><p>No. He wrote that he might be detained. But won't you sit down?</p>
